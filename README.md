## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm/yarn
- **Supabase Account** - Free tier available at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
- **Git** - For version control

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clarelations.git
cd clarelations
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Supabase

1. **Create a Supabase project** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Get your credentials** from Project Settings → API:
   - Project URL
   - Anon/Public Key
3. **Create environment file** - Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### 4. Run Database Migrations

Execute these SQL files in your [Supabase SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql) in order:

#### Step 1: Create Initial Schema
```sql
-- Run: supabase-schema.sql
-- Creates contacts, deals, and activities tables with indexes
```

#### Step 2: Update Deals Table
```sql
-- Run: update-deals-table.sql
-- Adds name, use_case, signal columns and removes old columns
```

#### Step 3: Add Notes System
```sql
-- Run: supabase/migrations/20251109120000_add_notes_to_deals.sql
-- Adds JSONB notes column for note management
```

#### Step 4: Set Up File Storage
```sql
-- Run: supabase/migrations/20251109090812_storage_setup.sql
-- Creates deal-attachments bucket and adds attachments column
```

### 5. Configure Storage Policies

Run this SQL to enable file uploads for unauthenticated users:

```sql
-- Drop existing policies to avoid conflicts
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anon uploads to deal attachments" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can read deal attachments" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated uploads to deal attachments" ON storage.objects;

-- Allow anonymous uploads (for development)
CREATE POLICY "Allow anon uploads to deal attachments"
ON storage.objects 
FOR INSERT 
TO anon
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'deal-attachments');

-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public can read deal attachments"
ON storage.objects 
FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'deal-attachments');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload (for production)
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads to deal attachments"
ON storage.objects 
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'deal-attachments');
```

### 6. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to see the application running!

## 🔐 Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
Current configuration (customize for production):

```sql
-- Contacts table - Public access (development)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on contacts" 
ON contacts FOR ALL 
USING (true) 
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Deals table - Public access (development)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on deals" 
ON deals FOR ALL 
USING (true) 
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Storage - Anonymous uploads allowed (development)
-- See storage policies above
```

### Production Security Recommendations
1. **Enable Authentication** - Implement Supabase Auth
2. **User-Based RLS** - Restrict access to user's own data
3. **Role-Based Access** - Admin vs. User permissions
4. **API Rate Limiting** - Protect against abuse
5. **Authenticated Uploads Only** - Remove anonymous upload policy

## 📊 Database Schema

### Contacts Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE contacts (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  phone TEXT,
  company TEXT,
  position TEXT,
  linkedin TEXT,
  acquisition_channel TEXT,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
  tags TEXT[],
  address TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Deals Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE deals (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  contact_id BIGINT REFERENCES contacts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  use_case TEXT,
  stage TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'new',
  signal TEXT DEFAULT 'neutral',
  description TEXT,
  sort_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  attachments JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
  notes JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Activities Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE activities (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  contact_id BIGINT REFERENCES contacts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  deal_id BIGINT REFERENCES deals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Storage Buckets
- **deal-attachments** - Public bucket for file storage

## 🎨 UI Components

Built with **shadcn/ui** for consistent, accessible design:

- **Button** - Primary, secondary, outline variants

- **Sheet** - Slide-in panels for forms and details
- **Form** - Form inputs with validation
- **Select** - Dropdown selections
- **Textarea** - Multi-line text input
- **Badge** - Status indicators and labels

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **User Action** → Component event handler
2. **Action Call** → Server action function in `/actions`
3. **Supabase Query** → Database or Storage API
4. **Response** → Data returned to component
5. **State Update** → UI re-renders with new data
6. **Callback** → Parent components notified (onDealUpdated, etc.)

## 📝 Key Features Deep Dive

  1. User selects file via input
  2. File validated (size, type)
  3. Uploaded to Supabase Storage
  4. Metadata saved to deals.attachments JSONB column
  5. Public URL returned for access
- **Supported Types**: Documents, images, HTML, archives
- **Max File Size**: 10MB (configurable)
- **Storage**: Files organized by deal ID in folders

### Drag & Drop Kanban
- **Drag Deal Cards** between stage columns
- **Real-time Updates** to database
- **Optimistic UI** for instant feedback
- **Sort Order** maintained within columns
- **Visual Feedback** during drag operations

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Files Not Uploading
**Error:** "new row violates row-level security policy"

**Solution:** Run the storage policies SQL (see step 5 above)

### Environment Variables Not Loading
**Issue:** App shows "Using mock data mode"

**Solution:** 
1. Check `.env.local` exists in project root
2. Verify variable names start with `VITE_`
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

### Database Connection Issues
**Issue:** "Failed to fetch" or connection errors

**Solution:**
1. Check Supabase project is active
2. Verify credentials in `.env.local`
3. Check RLS policies are created
4. Ensure tables exist (run migrations)

### Attachments Not Showing After Upload
**Issue:** Files upload but don't appear when viewing deal

**Solution:**
1. Check `loadDealById.ts` includes `d.attachments` in SELECT
2. Verify attachments column is JSONB (not TEXT[])
3. Run: `fix-attachments-column.sql`
